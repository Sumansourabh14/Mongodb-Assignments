1. use db.zipcodes.find() to filter results to only the results where city is ATLANTA and state is GA. 

Ans. 

db.zipcodes.find({$and: [{city: "ATLANTA"}, { state: "GA"}]})

2. use db.zipcodes.aggregate with $match to do the same as above. 

Ans. 

db.zipcodes.aggregate({$match: {$and: [{city: "ATLANTA"}, { state: "GA"}]}})

3. use $group to count the number of zip codes in Atlanta. 

Ans.

db.zipcodes.aggregate([{$match: {city: "ATLANTA"}}, {$count: "zipcodes"}])


4. use $group to find the total population in Atlanta. 

Ans.


Populations By State 

1. use aggregate to calculate the total population for each state 

Ans. 



2. sort the results by population, highest first

Ans.  

3. limit the results to just the first 3 results. What are the top 3 states in population? 

Ans.


Populations by City 

1. use aggregate to calculate the total population for each city (you have to use city/state combination). You can use a combination for the _id of the $group: { city: '$city', state: '$state' } 

Ans. 



2. sort the results by population, highest first 

Ans. 

db.zipcodes.aggregate([{$group: {_id: {pop: "$pop", city: "$city"}}}, {$sort: {_id: -1}}])


3. limit the results to just the first 3 results. What are the top 3 cities in population?

Ans. 

db.zipcodes.aggregate([{$group: {_id: {pop: "$pop", city: "$city"}}}, {$sort: {_id: -1}}, {$limit: 3}]) 

4. What are the top 3 cities in population in Texas? 

Ans. 

db.zipcodes.aggregate([{$match: {state: "TX"}}, {$group: {_id: {pop: "$pop", city: "$city"}}}, {$sort: {_id: -1}}, {$limit: 3}])
